ExGrid- drop-in replacement for egui::Grid with superpowers:

- alternative/improved layout mode dedicated to narrow windows (it's not grid there, but rather some group based layout)
- supports "subdata" (rows that are indented hidden behind collapsible, but columns are still aligned with top grid)
